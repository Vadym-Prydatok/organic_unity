My work using React, TypeScript, React Routing, Redux, and Firebase is a web application that allows users to create accounts in the Firebase database, easily log in to their accounts, and change their personal profile information. I created it for testing purposes before using it in the original project. In our project, registration requires confirmation of an email address via a letter or a phone number via SMS. This is all easily configured in the Firebase project account. In this template, I have disabled this feature so that you can easily create a user and log in to your account, and my account is also available where you can view your data and change it.
